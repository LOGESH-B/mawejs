Plans & sketches

SplitView: By default, there is one editor. But you should be able to split
the view, and have two editors side to side, to be able to edit your story
at two different locations.

Furthermore, you would be able to load another story in to your editor, so
that you are able to split & merge stories together. Examples:

- During writing your story you realize that some of your planned plots could
  work better as a spinoff: split the view, create new story, drag & drop pieces
  from your main story to splitted view and save it as a spinoff.
  
- During your work, you realize you have another story containing great stuff
  for this story. Open it in splitview, and drag&drop elements to your main story.
