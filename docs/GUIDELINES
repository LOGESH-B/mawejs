                        -----------------


The most important feature for a tool for writer is to manage the text mass.
If you consider a 300 page novel, it can be hard to edit the content alone as
as big bunch of text. Now, when you consider that most novels have lots of
meta text - plans, sketches and such - keeping track of all of them can be
painful with regular text editors or word processors.

We need to be able to develop the story in more manageable pieces. We need to
be able to store meta data to the text (that is, plans, ideas, design, synopses),
and we need to have a tool that can show us that meta data in meaningful way
when writing.

Second thing in an editor aimed for fiction writers is that it should be as
easy to use as possible. Few of the guidelines:

- "Just start writing": when you open the editor, you can start writing
  your story immediately, just like opening a notepad. No need for any kind
  of setup. Getting back to a story you rejected four years ago should be easy.
  
- All meta data is added later, when the story grows. They should be tools
  you take in use when you need them. For example, at some point you might want
  to create a bigger view to your story, and you start writing synopses to
  chapters. At some point you may need to sketch some events, and you add those
  sketches to your story. But never ever they should be mandatory things to do
  when writing.

Most stories get their "initial" shape pretty quickly. You have an idea of
a character, or how it starts, how it ends, or what is the turning point. You
might have idea where it happens, or when it happens.

The difficult thing is to weave the pieces of the story so that it goes through
the initial idea. Close all writers do not lack ideas: they just lack ideas for
those small things tieing certain pieces together.

Some other design guidelines:

- This is an editor for writers: writers use keyboard, so UI will use
  keyboard.
  
- "WYSIWYG": As far as possible, make it look just like what you get when
  printing it out. Try to minimize all distractions.

- It is an editor for writing, not for typesetting. Be very, very cautious
  to give the user anything to mess up with typesettings (fonts, faces,
  justifying, ...)

- Views: What writer needs most is not a typewriter, but an ability to view
  her/his story from multiple angles. You need to have different views to the
  story, and in each view, you should be able to modify it directly.

  Viewing story from multiple view points is more important than you
  first think. Just like a sculptor, you will be turning your subject
  to different angles to be able to sculpt it at one point.

We need to make some scoping for the project:

- Generally, the editor is mainly meant to write short stories. Let's
  say that at maximum it can be used to edit stories with around 50,000 - 80,000
  words, formed from around 50-80 scenes, and split to 3-5 parts or around 15-25
  chapters.
