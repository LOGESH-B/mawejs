                        -----------------


First and foremost rule: "Just start writing" - when you open the editor,
you can start writing your story immediately, just like opening a notepad. No
need for any kind of setup.

So, the default state of the editor should be just like another notepad, notepad++,
wordpad or google docs.

"All tools are applied only until you need them."

The magic comes later. What differs between regular text editors and word
processors to a tool meant for writers, is that they need to have tools to
keep large text masses organized.

If you consider a 300 page novel, it can be hard to edit the content alone as
as big bunch of text. Now, when you consider that most novels have lots of
meta text - plans, sketches and such - keeping track of all of them can be
painful with regular text editors or word processors.

We need to be able to develop the story in more manageable pieces. We need to
be able to store meta data to the text (that is, plans, ideas, design, synopses),
and we need to have a tool that can show us that meta data in meaningful way
when writing.

To implement this without breaking the first rule, all these things will be done
later, when the text mass keeps growing. First you start splitting your text to
smaller pieces, then you start adding plans and sketches. At some point you may
need synopses as guiding lines when writing a chapter. But all this, it is made
afterwards: no need to make preparations and setups until you think you will need
a tool.

"Work on keyboard"

As much as possible, it would be great to be able to use tools with keyboard,
without needing to use mouse. Mouse is of course good tool when you are trying
out the editor, but later you would like to use keyboard commands.

Most stories get their "initial" shape pretty quickly. You have an idea of
a character, or how it starts, how it ends, or what is the turning point. You
might have idea where it happens, or when it happens.

The difficult thing is to weave the pieces of the story so that it goes through
the initial idea. Close all writers do not lack ideas: they just lack ideas for
those small things tieing certain pieces together.

Some other design guidelines:

- "WYSIWYG": As far as possible, make it look just like what you get when
  printing it out.
  
- Try to minimize distractions. The less options the writer has for everything
  else but the story itself, the better. Try to keep the configurability at
  minimum.

- It is an editor for writing, not for typesetting. Be very, very cautious
  to give the user anything to mess up with typesettings (fonts, faces,
  justifying, ...)

- Views: What writer needs most is ability to view her/his story from multiple
  angles. You need to have different views to the story, and in each view, you
  should be able to modify it directly.

  Viewing story from multiple view points is more important than you
  first think. Just like a sculptor, you will be turning your subject
  to different angles to be able to sculpt it at one point.

Generally, the editor is mainly meant to write shorter stories. Let's say that
initially the editor is meant to edit stories with around 50,000 - 80,000 words
at maximum, organized to around 50 scenes, and split to 3-5 parts, or around 15-25
chapters. If you are working with your fantasy "trilogy" containing seven
1,200 page books, you may either need another tool, or split the work to smaller
pieces and use integrated project manager to keep track of the entire work.

We will initially integrate project manager to the editor. Initially, project manager
mainly serves linking short stories together, but we might later add tools to use
it to manage multipart series. This might be even favored way to write really
large works, so the core editor would not become overly complex.

Basically later additions for longer series would include more tools for resources
shared between stories, for example character and world descriptions and plans
and such. In fact, these are most probably first tools we anyways need in the
editor and project manager: I personally need ability to have "shared tags", as
many of my stories share the same background world, some characters and such.
