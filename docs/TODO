TODO:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Toolbar should be view specific.

- First things first: we can develop the editor by using browser local
  storage, file drops and file downloads. We could integrate cloud storages
  (Google Drive and DropBox) later.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General:


- What we know for sure, is that a story is a sequence of scenes.

- What we also know for sure, is that we need to be able to store metadata
  at various levels: for one scene, for a chapter, for entire story. We need
  to be able to link other documents to the story, for example, links to
  documents describing the backgrounds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Software needs to be organized so that it has "views": what editor needs
  most, is tools to view the story from different angles. Main view is
  "draft" view - it lets you edit your story close the same way as you down
  with regular text editors. But you need more: you need to be able to review
  the synopses, the structure of the story, and so on.

- It is important, that write aid tools are available when writing (if wanted).
  For example, it is good idea to have the synopses on the screen when working
  with scene.

- Lets not yet pay too much attention for editing the story. Lets first concentrate
  on creating views to a story. Lets then make those views "editable"

- NOTE: It should be easy to have "splitted" editor, that is, only chosen scenes
  would be visible. Give user tools to choose what parts of the text s/he is
  editing.

Integration:

- Google Drive support: load & store stories from Google Drive, store
  project manager database to google drive. Export stories to google
  drive.

Project manager:

- Implement project manager

- Listing projects, filtering etc

- Online publishing? Integrated to project manager?

Publishing:

- Need to be designed. How to organize stories, and publish them e.g.
  in wordpress?

Import & Export:

- Loading and storing stories to Google Drive and similar.

- Export RTF

- Export EPUB

- Export HTML (for e.g. WordPress)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice-to-have features:

- Opening multiple stories and moving scenes between them. This would be nice
  for splitting and merging stories.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO: Small things:

- Drag'n'drop without mouse: Somehow, you should be able to grab your scene,
  and start moving it around. Maybe "move up" / "move down" functionality?

  - Maybe Alt-G (grab) enters a state where you can move scene around with
    cursor keys? Alt-G again would revert back to normal mode.
  
- Lose focus: Get rid of sheet focus to be able to go around with page
  up & down. Also, regain focus to somewhat nice spot?
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE:

- Browser (Chrome) find seems to work perfectly!
