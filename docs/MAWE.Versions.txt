VERSIONS INSIDE .MAWE FILES

There is also discussion about the subject in MAWE.FileFormat.txt document.

<body> and <version> sections are equally structured:

    <body>
        <head> ... </head>
        <part> ... </part>
        <part> ... </part>
        ...
    </body>

    <version>
        <head> ... </head>
        <part> ... </part>
        <part> ... </part>
        ...
    </version>

A MAWE file can have multiple <version> sections, but only one
<body> section. <body> section marks the version that is currently
actively edited. It should help fetching file info, as you need
just get ./body/head to extract that info.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is three ways to make a new version:

(1) Make a version by making a copy of current body:

        <body>...Some text...</body>
        <version>...Some different text...</version>

    ==>

        <body>...Some text...</body>
        <version>...Some text...</version>
        <version>...Some different text...</version>

Basically, you leave a mark behind, while still continuing actively
working on <body>.

(2) Switch version: you choose some other version, which comes
the current body, and coby becomes a version:

        <body>...Some text...</body>
        <version>...Some different text...</version>

    ==>

        <body>...Some different text...</body>
        <version>...Some text...</version>

(3) Create entirely new, empty body: current body becomes a version:

        <body>...Some text...</body>
        <version>...Some different text...</version>

    ==>

        <body></body>
        <version>...Some text...</version>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both <body> and <version> have name attribute. It is not mandatory and it does 
not need to be unique, but it probably helps if the name gives some meaningful
information to the writer.

  <body name="v2.2" />
  <version name="v2.0" />
  <version name="v1.1" />

Version name can be chosen freely. It can be e.g. publisher's name, if you have 
saved version you sent to some publisher at some point, or a name of competition
you sent the text, e.g.

  <version name="Random House 5/2019"> ... </version>
  <version name="Hugo 3/2018"> ... </version>
