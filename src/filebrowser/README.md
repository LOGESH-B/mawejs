File browser for editor, similar to e.g. Nautilus. To be used to open and save files.

What features we need:

- Choosing files (for opening)
- Saving a file (giving a name and location for a saved file)
- Creating folders
- Renaming files
- Deleting files
- Moving files
- Searching

In addition to work with local file systems, it would be great if it works with
all sorts of network storages (google drive, dropbox).
