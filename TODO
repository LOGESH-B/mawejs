NOTES

- Discussion about file types (.mawe, .mawe.gz, versioned file) moved
  to separate document (docs/FileTypes.txt).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO:

- Import RTF: https://www.npmjs.com/package/rtf-parser - many writers Use
  Word or similar, and they can make RTFs.

- Borrow ideas to file browser from Dropbox web browser.

- Can we do / do we need fake app for test bench?

- Command line usage? It would be great if you could run the software without
  window, just from command line. It would give all sorts of great opportunities
  to integrate editor to other systems (e.g. automatic exports and other
  operations). You could basically make some automatic imports, too?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSIONS:

- Modification time needed mainly when saving versions (so that you know
  when that version was modified last time) needs to be thought...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE:

- Some kind of test bench for e.g. file operations would be great! That is,
  testing file loading & saving, directory scanning and so on.
      
--> it would be great, if file & document operations would work also
    in plain node (that is, without electron). I am sure that at Some
    point I like to have command line tools for e.g. exporting stories
    in different format.

- Make fake window to test code on plain node

- Get rid of body.modified - it makes version control very difficult.

- Check: load -> save --> produces same buffer. A more precise test
  needs to be created later.
