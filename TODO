TODO:

- Some kind of test bench for e.g. file operations would be great! That is,
  testing file loading & saving, directory scanning and so on.
      
--> it would be great, if file & document operations would work also
    in plain node (that is, without electron). I am sure that at Some
    point I like to have command line tools for e.g. exporting stories
    in different format.
