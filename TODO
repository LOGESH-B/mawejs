TODO:

- Import RTF: https://www.npmjs.com/package/rtf-parser - many writers Use
  Word or similar, and they can make RTFs.

- If story body does not have mod time, take it from file item.

- Borrow ideas to file browser from Dropbox web browser.

- Make fake app for node test bench

- Get rid of body.modified - it makes version control very difficult.

- Check: load -> save --> produces same buffer

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IDEAS:

- Use temp files in application directory to make "version control", that is,
  retrieving some older version of a file in case of extreme damage. Make it
  so that app can keep track of temp files - that is, rebuild index and link
  if crashing. Too old versions can be deleted.

  - NOTE: If editing on multiple computers, it works imperfectly. Cannot help.

- Track word counts in application directory. This way it would be possible
  to see, how many words you have been written in specific week or month.

  - NOTE: If editing on multiple computers, it works imperfectly. Maybe it is
    better create some sort of database to project tree root (that is, where
    the projects are scanned). So the database is located at the same place
    as the stories.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE:

- Some kind of test bench for e.g. file operations would be great! That is,
  testing file loading & saving, directory scanning and so on.
      
--> it would be great, if file & document operations would work also
    in plain node (that is, without electron). I am sure that at Some
    point I like to have command line tools for e.g. exporting stories
    in different format.
